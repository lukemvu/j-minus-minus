3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Long and Double Basic Types):
      Approach:
      - searched for all instances of INT and added LONG and DOUBLE support

      Issues and resolution:
      - issue with parser parsing double instead of long in declaration for
      - fibonacci as well as soem local vars
      - found issue with missing class descriptor, looking for double.class
      - and long.class, tracing for int.class
      - tried Type.java field descriptors added in type.java
      - private static String descriptorFor(Class<?> classRep) {
      - to find out names, did a google search for jvm desciptor
      - added missing
      - : classRep == double.class ? "D"
        : classRep == long.class ? "J"

   Problem 2 (Operators):
      Approach:

      - similarly to how it was done in project 1, I added new functions such
      as conditionalOrExpession. Found where operators belonged in expressions
      added their features

      Issues and resolution:
      - no issues, GS passed

   Problem 3 (Conditional Expression):
      Approach:
      - create new method for it and place in between assignment expression
      and conditionalOR
      - start like all other expressions
      - studied other methods, notably referenceType()
      - use mustBe to consume tokens, and parExpression
      - jifstatement, takes 4 params, line condition, then else
      - looked inside jConditionalExpression
      - takes 4 parameters, line condition then else
      - time consuming

      Issues and resolution:
      - no issues, worked on GS
